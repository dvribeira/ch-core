Code System URI 'http://ihe.net/fhir/ValueSet/IHE.FormatCode.codesystem' is unknown so the code cannot be validated
Unable to check if http://fhir.ch/ig/ch-epr-term/ValueSet/DocumentEntry.mimeType is a proper subset of http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/mimetypes|4.0.1 - base value set is too large to check
